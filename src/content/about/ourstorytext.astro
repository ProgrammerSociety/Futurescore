    <h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Introduction to Computer Science is part of Harvard's free courses available on the internet, for all in the globe, for free. Every year, thousands of students take up some of the tech courses offered. Anza Kutama was one of them. On an Instagram post by the CS50 official page showing a meme of a guy celebrating his completion certificate, he asked whether anyone would like to join the project. And of course, willing individuals raised their arms at the proposal and the group was formed.
The mission was clear, they all got on the same page after some many hours of meetings and project plannings, and it was time to start working. To start coding the actual platform and putting the pieces together...

<p><b>This is what Anza Kutama, had to say when asked about Youth Participation and Advocacy, and why these two are important when building a sustained economy</b></p>

<p>"Youth participation and advocacy are important to due the simple underlying fact that the youth are the foundation and building blocks of a future prosperous and sustainable society. Youth participation and advocacy are also crucial for several reasons:</p>

<p><b>Innovative Ideas</b>: Young people are known for their creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit. They bring fresh and unique perspectives to the table and can offer new solutions to complex issues facing African nations. Engaging young people can result in new ideas and approaches that are critical for advancing Africa's sustainable development goals.

<p><b>Social Cohesion</b>: Youth participation and advocacy can also foster social cohesion by building bridges across diverse groups, promoting dialogue, and encouraging the participation of all segments of society. This can lead to greater social harmony, improved trust in institutions, and better governance overall.</p>

<p><b>Sustainable Economic Growth</b>: Engaging young people in economic activities can be a significant driver of sustainable economic growth. By investing in education, training, and entrepreneurship opportunities for young people, African nations can unlock their potential and contribute to sustainable economic growth, resulting in poverty reduction and greater economic prosperity.</p>

<p><b>Global Engagement</b>: As the world becomes more interconnected and interdependent, it is essential for African youth to be actively engaged in global issues, policies, and networks. Youth participation and advocacy can enable young people to engage with their peers from other parts of the world, share best practices, and collaborate on global challenges such as climate change and public health.</p>

<p>In summary, youth participation and advocacy are vital for advancing a well-governed, peaceful, economically sustainable, and globally engaged Africa. It is crucial that young people are given a voice and the opportunity to shape their future, as they represent the continent's future leaders and change-makers.</p>

<p><b>Why is Anza Kutama interested in any of these?</b>
<p>"I'm interested in joining in conversations of how we can, as a continent, strengthen our economic value through partnership and collaboration; create employment, advance our academic outputs and produce new technologies that'll shape and help us run our continent in the most efficient manner.</p>

<p>We are doing this through Futurescore, connecting academia."</p>
