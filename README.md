The MERN stack?
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

MongoDB — document database
Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

# Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. 
- Express.js is a server-side web framework, and 
- Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform.

This stack is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through [Which is Futurescore's target].
